//! # No-Loss-Lottery Module
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet implements a no-loss-lottery by taking user deposits, generating excess funds by staking funds with [`pallet_parachain_staking`]
//! and periodically selects a winner from participating users weighted by their deposit amount to receive a claim to the
//! accrued excess funds.
//! Funds withdrawn from the the lottery are subject to a timelock determined by parachain-staking before they can be claimed.
//!
//! ### Lottery Rules
//! 1. A drawing is scheduled to happen every [`Config::DrawingInterval`] blocks.
//! 2. A designated manager can start & stop the drawings as well as rebalance the stake to improve the yield generated through staking
//! 3. In order to prevent gaming of the lottery drawing mechanism, no modifications to this pallet are allowed [`Config::DrawingFreezeout`] blocks before a drawing
//!     This is needed e.g. using BABE Randomness, where the randomness will be known a day before the scheduled drawing
//! 4. Winnings must be claimed manually by the winner but there is no time limit for claiming winnings
//! 5. Deposits are instantly staked by the pallet
//! 6. Withdrawals must wait for a timelock imposed by [`pallet_parachain_staking`] and are paid out automatically (via scheduler) in the first lottery drawing after it expires
//! 7. The [`Config::ManageOrigin`] must at the same time be allowed to use [`frame_support::traits::schedule::Named`] e.g. `ScheduleOrigin` in `pallet_scheduler`
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//! 1. To enable fair winner selection, a fair and low-influience randomness provider implementing [`frame_support::traits::Randomness`], e.g. pallet_randomness
//! 2. To schedule automatic drawings, a scheduling pallet implementing [`frame_support::traits::schedule::Named`], e.g. pallet_scheduler
//! 3. To generate lottery revenue, [`pallet_parachain_staking`]
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! This pallet contains extrinsics callable by any user and a second set of extrinsic callable only by a *Lottery Manager* Origin
//! configurable as [`Config::ManageOrigin`] in the [`Config`] struct of this pallet.
//!
//! ### User Dispatchable Functions
//! * [`Call::deposit`]: Allows any user to deposit tokens into the lottery
//! * [`Call::request_withdraw`]: Allows any user to request return of their deposited tokens to own wallet
//! * [`Call::claim_my_winnings`]: Allows any user to transfer any accrued winnings into their wallet
//!
//! ### Manager Dispatchable Functions
//! * [`Call::start_lottery`]: Schedules periodic lottery drawings to occur each [`Config::DrawingInterval`]
//! * [`Call::stop_lottery`]: Cancels the current drawing and stops scheduling new drawings
//! * [`Call::draw_lottery`]: Immediately executes a lottery drawing ( can be called manually even if lottery is stopped )
//! * [`Call::process_matured_withdrawals`]: Immediately transfer funds of all matured withdrawals to their respective owner's wallets
//! * [`Call::liquidate_lottery`]: Unstakes all lottery funds and schedules [`Call::process_matured_withdrawals`] after the timelock period
//! * [`Call::rebalance_stake`]: Immediately unstakes overweight collators (with low APY) for later restaking into underweight collators (with high APY)
//!
//! ### Important state queries callable via RPC
//! * [`Pallet::next_drawing_at`]: Block number where the next drawing will happen
//! * [`Pallet::not_in_drawing_freezeout`]: False if deposits/withdrawals are currently frozen
//! * [`Pallet::current_prize_pool`]: Token amount currently in the pallet the winner would get if the drawing was now
//! Call these from a frontend as e.g.
//! ```bash
//!    curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"lottery_next_drawing_at","params": []}'
//!    curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"lottery_current_prize_pool","params": []}'
//!    curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"lottery_not_in_drawing_freezeout","params": []}'
//! ```
//!
//! Please refer to [`Pallet`] for more documentation on each function.
//! Furthermore, the storage items containing all relevant information about lottery state can be queried via e.g. the [polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api)
