             - That is  it. Git will add the correct paragraph at the end of your commit message.
             - **COMMAND** : ` $ git commit -s -S -m 'your_commit_message' `
             '-s' = 'Signed-off-by'
             '-S' = 'Verify commit using gpg key'
             - If there is more than one commit in your pull request and your git client is modern enough (2.13+), rebase the required number of commits with --signoff
             ` $ git rebase --signoff HEAD^^ `
             - Write ` ^ ` as many times as there are commits in your pull request. Then, force push:
             ` $ git push -f origin <your branch here, probably "master"> `
             - **ALL COMMITS MUST BE SIGNED**
