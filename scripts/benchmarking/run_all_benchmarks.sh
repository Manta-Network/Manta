# This script has three parts which all use the Substrate runtime:
# - Pallet benchmarking to update the pallet weights
# - Overhead benchmarking for the Extrinsic and Block weights
# - Machine benchmarking
#
# Should be run on a reference machine to gain accurate benchmarks
# current reference machine: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/5848
#
# Should be run from the root of the repo.
